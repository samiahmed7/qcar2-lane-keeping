# Autonomous Indoor Navigation using ROS2 for Quanser QCar

> **Autonomous Navigation • Mapping • Localization • Model Predictive Control • Obstacle Avoidance**

---

# Overview

This repository contains the complete software stack for autonomous indoor navigation on the **Quanser QCar** using **ROS2 Humble**.

The project was developed for indoor autonomous vehicle demonstrations and combines modern robotics algorithms with a modular ROS2 architecture to achieve reliable localization, smooth trajectory tracking, autonomous obstacle avoidance and emergency stopping.

Unlike conventional waypoint-following systems, this project records a trajectory using localization, processes it into a smooth reference path and follows it using a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). During execution, the vehicle continuously monitors its surroundings using LiDAR and performs autonomous lane changes whenever obstacles are detected.

The software has been designed with modularity in mind, allowing each subsystem to operate independently while communicating through standard ROS2 interfaces.

# Installation

## Clone the Repository

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone <repository_url>
```

## Build the Workspace

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build 
source install/setup.bash
```

To automatically source the workspace on every terminal:

```bash
echo "source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

```

---

# Required Dependencies

The following ROS2 packages are required:

- Cartographer ROS
- Navigation2
- robot_localization
- robot_state_publisher
- RViz2
- tf2
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

---

# Mapping

A new occupancy grid map can be generated using Cartographer.

Start the mapping system:

```bash
ros2 launch qcar_science_night_pkg qcar2_cartographer_original_launch.py
```

Drive the QCar through the complete environment while ensuring that all navigable areas are observed by the LiDAR. For best results:

- Drive slowly and smoothly.
- Avoid sudden steering inputs.
- Visit all corridors and intersections.
- Return close to the starting position before saving the map.

---

## Saving the Map

Save the Cartographer pose graph:

```bash
ros2 service call /write_state cartographer_ros_msgs/srv/WriteState \
"{filename: '/home/nvidia/demo_map.pbstream'}"
```

Export the occupancy grid for localization:

```bash
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli \
-f /home/nvidia/demo_map
```

The following files will be generated:

```
demo_map.pbstream
demo_map.pgm
demo_map.yaml
```

---

# Localization

Localization is performed using AMCL together with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

Launch the localization stack:

```bash
ros2 launch qcar_science_night_pkg science_night_slam.launch.py
```

Once the map has loaded:

1. Open RViz.
2. Select **2D Pose Estimate**.
3. Click on the vehicle's current position on the map.
4. Move the vehicle slightly until the localization converges.

Verify localization:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /amcl_pose
```

Recommended covariance values:

| Parameter | Recommended |
|-----------|-------------|
| x variance | < 0.02 |
| y variance | < 0.02 |
| yaw variance | < 0.02 |

You can also verify that the localization transform is stable:

```bash
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base_link
```

---

# Trajectory Recording

Reference trajectories are recorded after localization has converged.

Start the trajectory recorder:

```bash
ros2 run qcar_science_night_pkg qcar2_trajectory_recorder
```

Drive the desired route once.

A CSV file containing the recorded trajectory will be generated.

Example:

```
qcar_trajectory.csv
```

---

# Trajectory Processing

The recorded trajectory is converted into a smooth reference path suitable for the MPC controller.

Processing includes:

- Removal of stationary points
- Cubic B-Spline fitting
- Uniform waypoint resampling
- Heading computation
- Curvature computation

Generate the processed trajectory:

```bash
python3 smooth_path.py \
--input qcar_trajectory.csv \
--output recorded_path_amcl_final.npy
```

The resulting trajectory contains:

```
x
y
yaw
curvature
```

This processed trajectory is used directly by the MPC controller.

---

# Autonomous Driving

**Localization only estimates the vehicle pose and does not command the vehicle to move.**

After localization has successfully converged, autonomous driving is started by launching the **Model Predictive Controller (MPC)**.

## Before Starting MPC

Ensure that:

- Hardware drivers are running.
- EKF localization is running.
- AMCL localization has converged.
- The map has been loaded.
- A reference trajectory (`.npy`) is available.
- The transform between `map` and `base_link` is stable.

Verify localization:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /amcl_pose
```

Verify the TF tree:

```bash
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base_link
```

Once localization is stable, launch the MPC controller:

```bash
ros2 run qcar_science_night_pkg mpc_controller
```

Launching the MPC controller starts autonomous vehicle motion.

During operation the controller will:

1. Load the processed reference trajectory.
2. Read the vehicle pose from AMCL.
3. Compute steering and velocity commands using Model Predictive Control.
4. Track the reference trajectory.
5. Continuously monitor for obstacles.
6. Perform autonomous lane changes when safe.
7. Return to the original lane after overtaking.
8. Stop immediately if an emergency condition is detected.
9. Stop automatically once the final waypoint has been reached.

> **Important:** The QCar will remain stationary until the MPC controller is started, even if localization is active.

---

# Obstacle Avoidance

Obstacle avoidance is performed using the onboard LiDAR.

The system continuously monitors:

- Front lane
- Left lane
- Right lane
- Emergency zone

Lane changes are only initiated when:

- An obstacle is detected within the configured activation distance.
- The target lane is clear.
- The adjacent lane has been verified to be free.

If no safe maneuver exists, the vehicle performs a controlled stop.

---

# Emergency Stop

An independent emergency stop system monitors the forward region using the Intel RealSense D435i.

If an object suddenly enters the emergency zone:

- Vehicle commands are cancelled.
- The MPC controller is interrupted.
- The QCar stops immediately.

This safety layer operates independently of obstacle avoidance.

---

# Demonstration Procedure

The recommended startup sequence is:

1. Power on the QCar.
2. Start hardware drivers.
3. Launch the EKF.
4. Launch the localization stack.
5. Set the initial pose in RViz.
6. Wait until AMCL converges.
7. Verify the `map → base_link` transform.
8. Launch the MPC controller.
9. The vehicle begins autonomous navigation.

---

# Troubleshooting

## Map does not appear

```bash
ros2 topic echo /map
```

---

## Localization does not converge

```bash
ros2 topic echo /amcl_pose
```

Move the vehicle slightly to provide additional LiDAR observations.

---

## Vehicle does not move

Verify:

- MPC controller is running.
- Localization has converged.
- The processed trajectory file exists.
- No emergency stop is active.

---

## Unexpected Vehicle Stop

Check:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /depth_emergency_stop
```

Also verify the LiDAR obstacle detection status.

# Future Work

Future improvements include:

- Dynamic obstacle tracking
- Velocity planning
- Multi-obstacle overtaking
- Automatic localization routine
- Mission scheduler
- Traffic sign recognition
- Fleet coordination
- Web-based monitoring interface
